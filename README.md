# InterloperRegionSelection

A small mod for The Long Dark that lets you select the spawn region when you start an Interloper mode game â€“
just like you could when starting a Pilgrim, Voyageur, Stalker, or custom mode game.

## Installation

1. If you haven't done so already, install MelonLoader by downloading and running [MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe)
2. Download the latest version of `InterloperRegionSelection.dll` from the [releases page](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/InterloperRegionSelection/releases)
3. Move `InterloperRegionSelection.dll` into the Mods folder in your TLD install directory

## Instructions

1. Start a new game in Interloper mode:

2. Select one of the starting regions available in Interloper from the map:

   Selecting 'Random' results in the same spawn mode selection as in the unmodded game.
3. Select feats, choose a name for the save file, etc.
4. You spawn at an Interloper spawn point in the selected region:
